# Kubernetes Architecture for a Java Application 

![Kubernetes Architecture Diagram](architecture/Kubernetes%20Architecture%20for%20Java%20App.drawio.png)

This diagram illustrates a typical architecture for deploying a Java application on Kubernetes. The main components include:

- **Pods:** The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, each running one or more instances of the Java application.
- **Services:** Expose pods to internal or external traffic, providing load balancing and service discovery.
- **Ingress:** Manages external access to services, offering routing and SSL/TLS termination.
- **ConfigMaps & Secrets:** Store configuration data and sensitive information, such as credentials, for the application.
- **Persistent Volumes:** Provide durable storage for stateful components of the application.
- **Deployments/StatefulSets:** Manage the lifecycle, scaling, and updates of pods.
- **Namespaces:** Organize and isolate resources within the cluster for better management.

This architecture supports scalability, resilience, and maintainability for Java applications running in Kubernetes environments.
